# Fleet Soft - In progress..

Fleet Soft is an advanced car rental management software developed using .NET technology. It is a modular monolith application, meaning it consists of various modules that work together but are managed within a single application. Libraries have been specifically created for this application.

## Technologies

- ![.NET](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/.NET_Core_Logo.svg) **.NET** - Framework used for building the application.
- ![Docker](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/2019-07/Moby-logo.png) **Docker** - Tool for containerizing the application, providing portability and ease of deployment.
- ![PostgreSQL](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Postgresql_elephant.svg) **PostgreSQL** - Relational database used for storing application data.
- ![Kafka](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Apache_kafka.svg) **Kafka** - Messaging system used for asynchronous communication between application modules.
- ![Kubernetes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Kubernetes_logo_without_workmark.svg) **Kubernetes (k8s)** - Container orchestration system used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Domain Discovery Process

The entire domain discovery process of the application was conducted using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) techniques. Detailed information on this process is available on the Miro platform.

## Project Structure

The Fleet Soft project is organized in a modular manner, allowing for easy management and development of individual functionalities. Each module is responsible for a specific part of the application's business logic.
