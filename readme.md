Fleet Soft is an advanced car rental management software developed using .NET technology. It is a modular monolith application, meaning it consists of various modules that work together but are managed within a single application. Libraries have been specifically created for this application.

## Technologies

- **.NET** - Framework used for building the application.
- **Docker** - Tool for containerizing the application, providing portability and ease of deployment.
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database used for storing application data.
- **Kafka** - Messaging system used for asynchronous communication between application modules.
- **Kubernetes (k8s)** - Container orchestration system used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.


## Domain Discovery Process

The entire domain discovery process of the application was conducted using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) techniques. Detailed information on this process is available on the Miro platform.

## Project Structure

The Fleet Soft project is organized in a modular manner, allowing for easy management and development of individual functionalities. Each module is responsible for a specific part of the application's business logic.
